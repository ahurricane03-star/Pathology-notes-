🧬 PATHOLOGY NOTES (Ultra-Short + High Yield)

1️⃣ Cell Injury

Definition

When cells cannot maintain normal homeostasis due to stress → they undergo injury.
If reversible → recovery.
If irreversible → cell death.

Types

A. Reversible Cell Injury

ATP ↓

Cellular swelling (hydropic change)

Fatty change

Plasma membrane blebs

Ribosome detachment
(Hallmark = cellular swelling)


B. Irreversible Cell Injury

Mitochondrial damage (no ATP)

Lysosomal rupture

Severe membrane damage

Calcium influx
(Hallmark = plasma membrane damage)

2️⃣ Causes of Cell Injury

Hypoxia / Ischemia (most common)

Chemical agents

Infections

Immune reactions

Genetic defects

Nutritional imbalances

Physical agents (trauma, radiation)


3️⃣ Mechanisms of Cell Injury

ATP depletion

Mitochondrial damage

Calcium influx

Oxidative stress (ROS)

Membrane damage


☠️ CELL DEATH

1️⃣ Necrosis (Pathological)

Features

Loss of membrane integrity

Enzyme leakage

Inflammation present

Always pathological


Types

1. Coagulative necrosis – Heart, kidney, spleen


2. Liquefactive necrosis – Brain infarct, abscess


3. Caseous necrosis – TB (“cheese-like”)


4. Fat necrosis – Pancreatitis (saponification)


5. Fibrinoid necrosis – Immune-mediated (vasculitis)


6. Gangrenous necrosis

Dry – coagulative

Wet – bacterial infection + liquefactive


2️⃣ Apoptosis (Programmed Cell Death)

Features

Controlled, energy-dependent

No inflammation

Cell shrinkage

DNA fragmentation

Membrane blebbing

Apoptotic bodies removed by macrophages


Causes

Embryogenesis

DNA damage

Hormone withdrawal (endometrium)

Viral infections

Immune-mediated killing


🧪 Free Radicals (ROS)

Sources

Mitochondria

Radiation

Inflammation (neutrophils)


Damage

Lipid peroxidation

DNA damage

Protein damage


Neutralization

Antioxidants (Vit A, C, E)

Superoxide dismutase

Catalase


💥 Ischemia–Reperfusion Injury

When blood supply returns after ischemia → sudden ROS production → more damage.


🧫 Atrophy, Hypertrophy, Hyperplasia, Metaplasia

Atrophy

Decrease in size/number of cells
Causes: ↓ workload, denervation, ischemia, ageing

Hypertrophy

Increase in cell size
Example: LV hypertrophy in hypertension

Hyperplasia

Increase in number of cells
Example: hormonal – endometrium, BPH

Metaplasia

Reversible change of one adult cell type → another
Example:

Smokers: columnar → squamous

Barrett’s esophagus: squamous → columnar
